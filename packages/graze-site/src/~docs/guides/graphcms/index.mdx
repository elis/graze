# Graze ðŸ”Œ GraphCMS

## Introduction

This tutorial will have you setting up a content management using GraphCMS in minutes.

The tutorial assumes that you have a free GraphCMS account, and that you have Node.js and npm installed locally.

Also make sure that you're familiar with the basics of [Graze setup](/getting-started).

## Set Up

Install the Graze GraphCMS Plugin:

```sh

$ npm add --save graze-plugin-graphcms
```

1. Create GraphCMS Account
2. Create a new project

<ProTip title='### Use "Clone Project"'>
  It's recommended that your first project will be a temporary testing project;
  once you've setup the content to your preferences it's recommended to clone
  a project (with or without data) and use the production site/app with the cloned
  project.
