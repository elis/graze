# Setting Up Graze

To create a new Graze project using [NPX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) run:

```bash
$ npx create-graze-app my-project my-heroku-app https://api-euwest.graphcms.com/v1/cjv1i750d3ck501ehkkpiprx8/master
```

Or by installing [`create-graze-app`](https://npmjs.com/package/create-graze-app) as a global executable:

```bash
$ npm add -g create-graze-app

...

$ create-graze-app my-project my-heroku-app https://api-euwest.graphcms.com/v1/cjv1i750d3ck501ehkkpiprx8/master
```

Or by using Yarn's [**create**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) command:


```bash
$ yarn create graze-app my-project my-heroku-app https://api-euwest.graphcms.com/v1/cjv1i750d3ck501ehkkpiprx8/master
```

This will run through the installation process and create your project directory ready to start working with and to quickly deploy the result to your favorite cloud provider.

Once the setup is complete, cd into your project's directory and start the development server:

```bash
$ cd my-project

$ yarn start
```

If you haven't modified any of the settings your app should be accessible on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

<ProTip title='### Heroku Appz'>

  Alhtough this version comes with an integrated Heroku configuration,
  you don't have to use Heroku to deploy your Graze app - any nodejs supporting
  provider can be used.

<ProTip title='### Heroku Free Account'>

  Heroku is a great cloud provider and allows free accounts - it's highly recommended
  to create an account and try it around - it's really awesome.

<ProTip title='### GraphCMS'>
  v0.1 of Graze comes with support for GraphCMS â€” a headless CMS provider with GraphQL
  out of the box, which together with Graze's architecture is a great combination for
  dynamic sites and apps.

  GraphCMS allows creating free projects that allow you evaluate the service before committinng to it. While it's not absolutely required to use Graze it's highly recommended to give it a try: [Create GraphCMS account](https://app.graphcms.com/signup)
