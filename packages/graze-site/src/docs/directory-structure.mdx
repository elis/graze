# Directory Structure

## `src`

*./src*

### `components`

*./src/components*

Shared components.

It's recommended to create here the root component of your app/site, and include it as an [**Addon**](/plugins/app#addon). You can then easily port this component from one Graze installation to another for quick and painless upgrades.

### `docs`

*./src/docs*

This documentation.

Consider this as a suggestion to how to organize your own documentation, and perhaps check out the awesome [**docz**](https://www.docz.site/) documentation generator - it's great for getting your documentation, code, and content all accessible in the same context.

### `pages`

*./src/pages*

Site pages that will be rendered.

### `plugins`

*./src/plugins*

Graze plugins installed locally
