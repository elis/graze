## Components

`./src/components/`

Shared components.

It's recommended to create here the root component of your app/site, and include it as an [**Addon**](/plugins/app#addon). You can then easily port this component from one Graze installation to another for quick and painless upgrades.

Consider using a short-hand import/require syntax when loading components:

```js
import Article from 'components/articles'
```

It uses the `.env` file with a `NODE_PATH=src` to allow you to import directly from the `./src` directory much like it's done for `node-modules`.

## Docs

`./src/docs`

This documentation.

Consider this as a suggestion to how to organize your own documentation, and perhaps check out the awesome [**docz**](https://www.docz.site/) documentation generator - it's great for getting your documentation, code, and content all accessible in the same context.

Content in the **docs** directory is expected to be of `.mdx` type and support the convenient [Front Matter](https://www.scribendi.com/advice/front_matter.en.html) pattern to embelish `mdx` documents with (usually) YAML properties.

import { ProTip } from 'docs'

<ProTip title='MDX'>

  If you're not familiar with MDX — a powerful superset of Markdown — we highly recommend learing more about MDX and it's power: [**MDX - Markdown for the component era**](https://mdxjs.com/)
  
</ProTip>

<ProTip title='gray-matter'>

  Learn about [**gray-matter**](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) - the module used in Graze to compile Front Matter within `mdx` documents.

</ProTip>

Note that `graze-docs` and `docz` are only partially compatible at this point - so features available in one are not necesserily available in the other. This will improve soon as both projects mature.

## Pages

`./src/pages`

Site pages that will be rendered.

## Plugin

`./src/plugins`

Graze plugins installed locally.
