## Introduction

Graze is a set of tools to let you build high performing applicatios using the modern stack without compromizes or penalties.

It's designed to be blazing fast dynamic application that servers fully functional crisp looking applications rendered on the server-side.

Based on the amazing [**Razzle**](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/) package that simplifies Server-side Rendering along with a convenient and full-featured development enviroment with all the modern bells and whistels such as Hot Module Reloading.

Learn more in the [**Introduction Section**](/introduction).

## Plugins

Graze offers a simply yet powerful plugin API that gives you atmost control over your applications behaviour and fuctionality. Combined with the burgeoning eco-system of [Razzle plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=razzle-plugin) Graze is extremly capable and configurable to satisfy most projects needs.

The plugins can hook into the entire applications' life-cycle on the server-side and on the client side. With an intuitive and simple [Plugin Structure](/plugins#plugin-structure) you can quickly give your application the ability to run without any client-side executing what-so-ever, making it a perfect solution for embedded systems and low-power requirements.
